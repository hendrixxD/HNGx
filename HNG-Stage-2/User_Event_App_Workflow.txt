Event App User Flow and Key Features

After thorough analysis by available team members in our meeting earlier today, here's a concise overview of our event app built on Django Rest Framework, including user authentication via Google and Twitter. This will help us understand the system's flow and its key components:
1.User Registration and Authentication:
- Users can register and log in using their Google or Twitter accounts.
- OAuth2.0 is implemented for seamless authentication with these platforms.
2. User Groups:
- Users can create or join groups.
- Groups are central to our app and act as containers for events.
- Users can belong to multiple groups.
3. Events:
- Events are created within groups.
- Users can create events and associate them with specific groups.
- Events have attributes like start date, end date, location, and descriptions groups.

- Users can RSVP to events they plan to attend.

4. Permissions and Access Control:

- Access to group-related actions and events is permission-based.

- Group owners have administrative rights over their groups and events.

- Users can have different roles within groups, determining their level of control and access.

5. Notifications:

- Users receive notifications about group and event activities.

- Notifications can be sent via in-app notifications.

- User Profiles:

Users can customize their profiles with personal information, avatars, etc.

API Endpoints:

- We'll design RESTful API endpoints for all key functionalities, facilitating communication between the frontend and backend.

Database Schema:

User-related data, groups, events, and their relationships are stored in the database.
